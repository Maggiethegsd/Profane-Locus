# Profane-Locus
This is a game that I started development around October 2021, when I was playing the game Phasmophobia very much, which I had bought around September 2020 but never played. I found it was a really fun and genuinely terrifying with the then-new updates, like I literally couldn't play it at night alone. The thing I liked about the game most was that it wasn't those generic you're trapped in an abandoned hospital games, it was more like exploring a perfectly normal residential home at night, but it is haunted by an entity. I found the mechanics of the equipment and ghost AI very interesting, so I started experimenting around in Unity these mechanics and eventually thought of making a full project similar to Phasmophobia but with mechanics of own. I am also a big fan of the horror genre itself and watch a ton of ghost hunting 
videos on YouTube, so I'm taking a lot of inspiration from these videos as well. 

An important note is that I of course will not be uploading the full project here as it is planning to be a commercial game, rather I'll upload scripts I write that I feel are technical and ones that I've put a lot effort into, both in cleanliness and mapping out how the scripts work.

Hopefully it gets completed atleast upto some extent with the mechanics in it. Thank you!
